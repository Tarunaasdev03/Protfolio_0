# Photo Instructions

To add your photo to the portfolio:

1. Place your photo file in this `public` directory
2. Name it `your-photo.jpg` (or update the src in Hero.tsx to match your filename)
3. Make sure it's a square image (ideally 512x512 pixels or larger)
4. The photo will automatically be cropped to a circle and displayed in the hero section

If no photo is provided, the component will fallback to displaying your initials "TS".
